#Heroku 1: Getting Started Challenge

This is a "quick" challenge but very necessary. We're going to deploy a _dummy application_ using [_Heroku_] (http://www.heroku.com/).

The goal is to become familiar with how Heroku works and how to use it inside Dev Bootcamp. This will be easiest on your own personal laptop; getting a single machine to work with multiple Heroku accounts is a small nightmare.

##Objectives

###Follow the Heroku Guide

Start by following the steps in Heroku's [Getting Started with Ruby] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby) guide. 

It uses Sinatra. Don't use the Sinatra skeleton — just follow the directions in the Heroku guide.

One _significant difference_ will be the creation of a new file called _Procfile_. This tells _Heroku_ how to run your web server. Sometimes you have other services you also want to run, like _background workers_ or _message queues_, and the 

_Procfile_ tells Heroku how to run those, too.

Once you have your _dummy app_ up and _running submit a gist_ with a _link_ to your _application's URL_.
