￼# Heroku 1: Getting Started Challenge
This is a "quick" challenge but very necessary. We're going to deploy a dummy application using [Heroku] (http://www.heroku.com/) .
The goal is to become familiar with how Heroku works and how to use it inside Dev Bootcamp. This will be easiest on your own personal laptop; getting a single machine to work with multiple Heroku accounts is a small nightmare.
##Objectives
###Follow the Heroku Guide
Start by following the steps in Heroku's [Getting Started with Ruby] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby) guide. It uses Sinatra. Don't use the Sinatra skeleton — just follow the directions in the Heroku guide.
One significant difference will be the creation of a new file called Procfile. This tells Heroku how to run your web server. Sometimes you have other services you also want to run, like background workers or message queues, and the Procfile tells Heroku how to run those, too.
Once you have your dummy app up and running submit a gist with a link to your application's URL.
