{"name":"Heroku 1 getting started","tagline":"","body":"#Heroku 1: Getting Started Challenge\r\n\r\nThis is a \"quick\" challenge but very necessary. We're going to deploy a _dummy application_ using [_Heroku_] (http://www.heroku.com/).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to become familiar with how Heroku works and how to use it inside Dev Bootcamp. This will be easiest on your own personal laptop; getting a single machine to work with multiple Heroku accounts is a small nightmare.\r\n\r\n##Objectives\r\n\r\n###Follow the Heroku Guide\r\n\r\nStart by following the steps in Heroku's [Getting Started with Ruby] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby) guide. \r\n\r\nIt uses Sinatra. Don't use the Sinatra skeleton — just follow the directions in the Heroku guide.\r\n\r\nOne _significant difference_ will be the creation of a new file called _Procfile_. This tells _Heroku_ how to run your web server. Sometimes you have other services you also want to run, like _background workers_ or _message queues_, and the \r\n\r\n_Procfile_ tells Heroku how to run those, too.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your _dummy app_ up and _running submit a gist_ with a _link_ to your _application's URL_.\r\n￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
